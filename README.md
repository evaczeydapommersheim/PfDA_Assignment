# PfDA_Assignment - Project 1

#### This project has been prepared for the 2022 Winter Semester Course of HDip in Computing in Data Analytics, Programming for Data Analysis module led by Dr. Brian McGinley at Atlantic Technological University. 

## Assessment Task:
***
> - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could.
> - Collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
> - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
> - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
> - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## Chosen topic for assessment:

### After researching possible options I decided to explore an area that is related to the field of my current job in the medical device industry. The dataset of my choice was found in ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mennatallahnasr/stroke/data). It is called the Stroke Prediction Dataset and has the following attribute infomration:
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown" (Unknown meaning that the information was not available for the particular patient)
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

About the data:<p>
#### According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
#### This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
